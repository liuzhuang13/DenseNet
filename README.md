## Introduction
DenseNet is a network architecture where each layer is directly connected to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion (within each *dense block*). For each layer, the feature maps of all preceding layers are treated as separate inputs whereas its own feature maps are passed on as inputs to all subsequent layers. This connectivity pattern yields state-of-the-art accuracies on CIFAR10/100 (with or without data augmentation) and SVHN. On the large scale ILSVRC 2012 (ImageNet) dataset, DenseNet achieves a similar accuracy as ResNet, but using less than half the amount of parameters and roughly half the number of FLOPs.

## Usage 
0. Install Torch and required dependencies like cuDNN. See the instructions [here](https://github.com/facebook/fb.resnet.torch/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for a step-by-step guide.
1. Clone this repo: ```git clone https://github.com/liuzhuang13/DenseNet.git```

As an example, the following command trains a DenseNet-BC with depth L=100 and growth rate k=12 on CIFAR-10:
```
th main.lua -netType densenet -dataset cifar10 -batchSize 64 -nEpochs 300 -depth 100 -growthRate 12
``` 
As another example, the following command trains a DenseNet-BC with depth L=121 and growth rate k=32 on ImageNet:
```
th main.lua -netType densenet -dataset imagenet -data [dataFolder] -batchSize 256 -nEpochs 90 -depth 121 -growthRate 32 -nGPU 4 -nThreads 16 -optMemory 3
``` 
Please refer to [fb.resnet.torch](https://github.com/facebook/fb.resnet.torch) for data preparation.

### DenseNet and DenseNet-BC
By default, the code runs with the DenseNet-BC architecture, which has 1x1 convolutional *bottleneck* layers, and *compresses* the number of channels at each transition layer by 0.5. To run with the original DenseNet, simply use the options *-bottleneck false* and *-reduction 1*

### Memory efficient implementation (newly added feature on June 6, 2017)
There is an option *-optMemory* which is very useful for reducing GPU memory footprint when training a DenseNet. By default, the value is set to 2, which activates the *shareGradInput* function (with small modifications from [here](https://github.com/facebook/fb.resnet.torch/blob/master/models/init.lua#L102)). There are two extreme memory efficient modes (*-optMemory 3* or *-optMemory 4*) which use a customized densely connected layer. With *-optMemory 4*, the largest 190-layer DenseNet-BC on CIFAR can be trained on a single NVIDIA TitanX GPU (uses 8.3G of 12G) instead of fully using four GPUs with the standard (recursive concatenation) implementation . 

More details about the memory efficient implementation are discussed [here](https://github.com/liuzhuang13/DenseNet/tree/master/models).


## Results on CIFAR
The table below shows the results of DenseNets on CIFAR datasets. The "+" mark at the end denotes for standard data augmentation (random crop after zero-padding, and horizontal flip). For a DenseNet model, L denotes its depth and k denotes its growth rate. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 without data augmentation, a Dropout layer with drop rate 0.2 is introduced after each convolutional layer except the very first one.

## Wide-DenseNet for better Time/Accuracy and Memory/Accuracy Tradeoff

If you use DenseNet as a model in your learning task, to reduce the memory and time consumption, we recommend use a wide and shallow DenseNet, following the strategy of [wide residual networks](https://github.com/szagoruyko/wide-residual-networks). To obtain a wide DenseNet we set the depth to be smaller (e.g., L=40) and the growthRate to be larger (e.g., k=48).

We test a set of Wide-DenseNet-BCs and compared the memory and time with the DenseNet-BC (L=100, k=12) shown above. We obtained the statistics using a single TITAN X card, with batch size 64, and without any memory optimization.


Model | Parameters| CIFAR-10+ | CIFAR-100+ | Time per Iteration | Memory 
-------|:-------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
DenseNet-BC (L=100, k=12)|0.8M |4.51 |22.27 | 0.156s | 5452MB
Wide-DenseNet-BC (L=40, k=36)|1.5M |4.58 |22.30 | 0.130s|4008MB
Wide-DenseNet-BC (L=40, k=48)|2.7M |3.99 |20.29 | 0.165s|5245MB
Wide-DenseNet-BC (L=40, k=60)|4.3M |4.01 |19.99 | 0.223s|6508MB

Obersevations:

1. Wide-DenseNet-BC (L=40, k=36) uses less memory/time while achieves about the same accuracy as DenseNet-BC (L=100, k=12). 
2. Wide-DenseNet-BC (L=40, k=48) uses about the same memory/time as DenseNet-BC (L=100, k=12), while is much more accurate.

Thus, for practical use, we suggest picking one model from those Wide-DenseNet-BCs.
